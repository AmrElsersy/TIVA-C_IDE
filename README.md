# TIVA C IDE
## Introduction
TIVA C IDE is an Auto-Generated-Code IDE designed for TIVA C Microcontroller to generate drivers through configrations.
used technologies **Qt,QML,C++**

## GUI

UI Design is consist of 4 parts:
- TIVA C Simulation : to set the configrations of the TIVA C Drivers
- Directory Viewer  : to access the filesystem and let the user open/modify files
- Tab Editor        : to create / open new editors for the generated code & drivers
- Tool Bar          : to control the program

### Design Principles
- **Adapter Pattern** is used to abstract the communication's conversion between controller & generators classes
- **Program to Interface Principle** is achived through polymorphism, the controller deal with generators through an abstract one and dosn't care about its kind, the generator functionality is assigned @ runtime
- **Open-Closed Principle** is achived, a new generator class can be added without modifying(or even reading) controller & the main flow through the polymorphism & interfaces, so it is open for extentions but closed for modifications
